## Article abstract

Pterodroma hasitata, the Black-capped Petrel (locally known as Diablotin), is the only extant gadfly petrel nesting in the Caribbean. The species is listed as globally Endangered by the IUCN and was recently listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Pterodroma hasitata show a phenotypic gradient, ranging from a darker, smaller form to a paler, heavier form, that is reflected in a strong genetic structure. This phylogenetic divergence suggests the existence of at least two distinct breeding populations. We report on pre-breeding movements of two male Pterodroma hasitata, one of each form, tracked by satellite from non-breeding areas in Gulf Stream waters of the western North Atlantic Ocean to breeding locations in Hispaniola in late 2019. Based on a combination of tracking locations, location error classes, battery voltage, and satellite communication schedules, we infer that the light-form petrel visited a nest in central Dominican Republic during 2 to 8 October and 9 to 15 October, and the dark form visited a nest in southeastern Haiti during 9 to 22 November and 29 November to 3 December. This information supports earlier suggestions that Pterodroma hasitata forms breed in allochrony and in allopatry, both of which may be a driver of speciation.
